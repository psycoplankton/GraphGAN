# GraphGAN
* This repository is a reimplementation of the [GraphGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08267) architecture. However I have tried to increase the accuracies by using Fuzzy Logic dependent fuzzy layer which acts on the already generated pre-trained embeddings and increases the information content of the embeddings. You can find the repository to the code here [Fuzzy Representation Learning](https://github.com/psycoplankton/Fuzzy-Representation-Learning).

GraphGAN unifies two schools of graph representation learning methodologies: generative methods and discriminative methods, via adversarial training in a minimax game. The generator is guided by the signals from the discriminator and improves its generating performance, while the discriminator is pushed by the generator to better distinguish ground truth from generated samples.

* The code for GraphGAN architecture was taken from [hwwang](https://github.com/hwwang55/GraphGAN/tree/master). Do Check out his Github.

### DeepWalk Algorithm
(Link to the paper: [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6652))

The deep walk is an algorithm proposed for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations are used to represent the social representation b/w two graphs. It uses a randomized path traversing technique to provide insights into localized structures within networks. It does so by utilizing these random paths as sequences, that are then used to train a Skip-Gram Language Model.

### Node2Vec Algorithm
(Link to the paper: [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00653))

The node2vec framework learns low-dimensional representations for nodes in a graph by optimizing a neighborhood preserving objective. The objective is flexible, and the algorithm accomodates for various definitions of network neighborhoods by simulating biased random walks. Specifically, it provides a way of balancing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff that in turn leads to representations obeying a spectrum of equivalences from homophily to structural equivalence.

### Struc2Vec Algorithm
(Link to the paper: [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03165))

Structural identity is a concept of symmetry in which network nodes are identified according to the network structure and their relationship to other nodes. Structural identity has been studied in theory and practice over the past decades, but only recently has it been addressed with representational learning techniques. This work presents struc2vec, a novel and flexible framework for learning latent representations for the structural identity of nodes. struc2vec uses a hierarchy to measure node similarity at different scales, and constructs a multilayer graph to encode structural similarities and generate structural context for nodes.

### LINE(Large Scale Information Network Embedding)
(Link to the paper: [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03578)

The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference.
