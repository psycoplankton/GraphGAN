# GraphGAN
* This repository is a reimplementation of the [GraphGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08267) architecture. However I have tried to increase the accuracies by using Fuzzy Logic dependent fuzzy layer which acts on the already generated pre-trained embeddings and increases the information content of the embeddings. You can find the repository to the code here [Fuzzy Representation Learning](https://github.com/oneshhuu/Fuzzy-Representation-Learning).

GraphGAN unifies two schools of graph representation learning methodologies: generative methods and discriminative methods, via adversarial training in a minimax game. The generator is guided by the signals from the discriminator and improves its generating performance, while the discriminator is pushed by the generator to better distinguish ground truth from generated samples.

* The code for GraphGAN architecture was taken from [hwwang](https://github.com/hwwang55/GraphGAN/tree/master). Do Check out his Github.

### Folder Details  
* `DeepWalk`: Deepwalk algorithm folder.
  1) Contains the source code for deepwalk algorithm in the `.py` file.  
  2) Contains my implementation of the algorithm in the `.ipynb` file.
    
* `Pre-Train Embeddings`: Contains four different types of embeddings file.
  1) `CA-GrQc_pre_train.emb` contains the embeddings generated by the deepwalk algorithm.
  2) `CA-GrQc_pre_train_fuzzy_NoVarNorm_NoEmbNorm.emb` contains the defuzzified embeddings, and as the name suggests, without Variance and Embedding Normalisation.
  3) `CA-GrQc-pre_train_fuzzy_NoVarNorm_EmbNorm.emb` contains the defuzzified embeddings, with Embedding Normalisation but no Variance Normalisation.
  4) `testing.emb` Obviously I was not gonna use the above files, I am not organised :woozy_face:. As the name suggests, I test every set of embeddings by copying it to `testing.emb` file.

* `Embeddings`: Contains the embeddings of the Generator and the Discriminator, learnt during training.
  
* `Results`: Contains the results corresponding to each of the pre-train embeddings used.

* `src`: contains the source code for GraphGAN architecture.


### DeepWalk Algorithm
The deep walk is an algorithm proposed for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations are used to represent the social representation b/w two graphs. It uses a randomized path traversing technique to provide insights into localized structures within networks. It does so by utilizing these random paths as sequences, that are then used to train a Skip-Gram Language Model.
